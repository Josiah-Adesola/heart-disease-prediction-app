# PROBLEM STATEMENT

According to WHO 1.79 Million people die yearly due to Cardio-vascular diseases (CVD).  CVDs are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions. More than four out of five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age.

The most important behavioural risk factors of heart disease and stroke are unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol. The effects of behavioural risk factors may show up in individuals as raised blood pressure, raised blood glucose, raised blood lipids, and overweight and obesity.

However,identifying those at highest risk of CVDs and ensuring they receive appropriate treatment can prevent premature deaths.

This means prediction can be an effective tool in combating premature death from CVD.

# DATA-SOURCING

I curated my pre-processed data from kaggle website sourced from the original website UCI Machine Learning

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset

-----------------------------------------------------

# DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION

I used python for the data analysis and few visualizations. It was an awesome process.
The dataset consists of mostly youths and adults, which means children and teens are less susceptible to heart diseases. I also discovered Male had more heart diseases compared to Female, due to Tobacco, and working in unhealthy enviroment (air pollution) as someone hinted.

-----------------------------------------

# MODELLING

This problem is a classification one. I tried hands on several models such as DecisionTrees, RandomForest, SVM, KneighborsClassifier. But, RandomForest came out to be the best. So the data was trained with RandomForest for the best prediction.

# DEPLOYMENT

The app was built with Streamlit and deployed to Heroku.

The  web app is simple to use, you can easily not fill anything and just click the predict button at the button. Then it predicts if the person has an heart disease or not.
